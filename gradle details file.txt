gradle build -x test to skip unit test
gradle build --refresh-dependencies
gradle assemble

build vs assemble
assemble required task except test task while build run test task also with required task

-x test skip all unit test


to exclude some test  in build .gradle we can write test tast with regex to exclude 
test classes of specific package

build.gradle
test{
      exclude 'com.unit.test.module1.*'   
}

build.gradle
task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '2.10' //we want gradle 2.10 to run this project
}
